0.09 (pre-submission, things that need to be explicitely mentioned in the text):
- rotating_cone/test_issue.cpp ????
- G
- mpdata n_iters as a param
- nx,ny,nz as params?
- n_eqs as params...
- CMake install() rules (as in libcloudphxx)
- strang/midpoint/euler... into separate files, check nomenclature, reference to discussion in Smolarkiewicz 2006 (eqs. 28, 29, ...), Piotr mentioned relation with RK, improved Euler (eq. 32) / modified Euler (eq. 33)
- at least a "zero" bcond for icicle
- test showing difference between real_t=float and real_t=double (and real_t=long double, ...)
- doc: dependencies section (C++11, Blitz, Boost, OpenMP)
- doc: README and HACKING files
- doc: mention the difference between the order of accuracy of integration vs. order of accuracy of an approximation
- spreading drop test from Schar & Smolarkiewicz?
- doc: references for shallow-water docs incl. Vallis, http://www.netlib.org/chammp/shallow.bib
- asserts for incompatible opiotns (e.g. eps vs. -eps, ... gag -> n_iters)
- concurr -> rename concurr_ddecomp
- bcd_common -> rename dirichlet?


0.1 (pre-submission / during reviews, should-be-easy enhancements or code cleanups before first release):
- svg output -> git repo?
- rename/introduce output_serial common file
- some assert-like logic checking if the velocity field is consistent with the boudary condition?
- diagnostic stats map and output (conservativeness indicator, how to define multi-dimensional Courant number: was defined? (cf. Szmelter 2005, JCP, appendix))
- Molenkamp test?
- test showing usage of gss'c __float128 (rainbow?)
- pressure solvers: introduce inheritance (richardson->mr->cr->pc); what if no preconditioner in pc?; reuse richardson in pc; common loop over pseudo-time
- make ctors explicit? (http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml?showone=Explicit_Constructors#Explicit_Constructors)
- concurr_serial 
- check if all adv/*.hpp are testes 
- use this->ijk istead of this->i, this->j where it could reduce the number of methods (method_1d = method_2d)
- check at configure time what's fastest on the current machine: float vs. double, eps vs. where(), .5*(x+|x|) vs. max(x,0) and use these settings!
- handle bogus subdomain counts (e.g. 0)
- unify error handling (is there anything needed besides asserts... or boost.asserts?)
- check if velocity plots with arrows are feasible with output_gnuplot - if not forget about it
- split output_gnuplot into separate files
- check if unique_ptrs used and if so if not to change to const unique_ptr"- we do not need transferability
- mechanism for recording stats, and:
  - record C_min, C_max
  - record div(Cx, Cy)
  - record n_iters, error in pressure solvers
- barriers() within nabla operators?
- check if some enums could not be converted into c++11 enum classes
- test showing real_t=quantity<> or real_t=mpfr [real_t=int??? :)]
- move leapfrog from adv to tests and finish it
- change cyclic_1d, cyclic_2d... suffixed classes into templates (as it was done with solvers)
- multi-arguent (variadic) xchng to reduce number of barrier() calls
- setup(solver, ...) methods in tests do not need to take nx, ny as arguments - these are available via solver.state().extent()
- @cite instead of @copybrief hack for references? (@cite will work within biref descriptions since the upcoming doxygen release)
- Doxyfile.in (with some content generated by CMake)
- clang 3.3 has autovectorisation turned on by default with -O3 - perhaps get rid of this flag in CMakeLists (it was causing problems)



0.2: (near future enhancements, things important for the initial stages of the HARMONIA project)
- document (and check?) stability conditions for RHS terms
- support for specifying mpdata options per equation, and not globally for the whole system (e.g. positive definiteness)
- HARMONIA-relevant boundary conditions (rigid?, zero-gradient?, open/radiation?)
- mpdata_3d 



0.3: (not-so-near future enhancements, applicable to HARMONIA)
- MPI parallelisation (incl. remote boundary cond?)
- MPI-shared_mem setups
- fork distmem parallelisation for testing sharedmem without MPI
- concurr_opencl? http://www.multicoreinfo.com/2009/08/parprog-part-9/


0.4: (far future, not relevant to HARMONIA)
- support for non-carthesian geometries
- other advection algorithms?:
  - UNO: http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/2008MWR2451.1
  - Lax Wendroff http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs205b/lectures/lecture9.pdf
  - http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/1520-0450(1981)020%3C0146%3AAEOSSN%3E2.0.CO%3B2
- option to parallelise the computations by equations (and not by domain decomposition)
- automated -fprofile-use and -fprofile-generate with CMake? (here's an example: http://trac.research.cc.gatech.edu/fastlab/browser/trunk/fastlib/CMakeLists.txt?rev=9455)
- option to communicate while calculating the domain interior
- reimplement the isentropic model from icicle, here're some notes from a doc TODO:
  -  explain the isopycnic/isentropic relationship
  -  explain meaning of hydrostatic model
  -  explain why isentropic -> hydrostatic & compressible
  -  explain z -> theta transition
  -  explain why Montgomery potential and how it relates the Bernouli function
  -  include a scematic picture indicating what's defined per layer, and what's defined per surface
  -  explain how the heights are retrieved from pressures (via constant-density layers)
  -  Witch of Agnesi! :)
